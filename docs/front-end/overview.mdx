We've decided to use Angular for the front end. We may experiment with other technologies in the future.

We are using an Nx Workspace, which is described in more detail at [Nx](nx).

The frontend application uses a [ _Backend for Frontend_ architecture ](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/). The backend is a [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) application.
