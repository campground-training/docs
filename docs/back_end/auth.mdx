The backend provides an OIDC service for maintaining login/logout functionality and identity. It is implemented with [KeyCloak](https://www.keycloak.org/) service running in the cluster at https://auth.camping-training.com.

## Current

## Plan

We will have a `users` service. The responsibility of this service will be to:

1. Create new users as part of the onboarding feature.
1. Be a facade over keycloak for purposes of verifying user identity.
1. Keeping the data associated with a user.
